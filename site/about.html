        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Reece Jones is a photographer based in North Sydney, Australia.
            Starting out in 2023, his journey with photography has always been one of experimentating and learning.
            Reece works with a variety of photography styles and subjects and is not afraid to go against mainstream styles to achieve a creative vision.
            Currently, his photographic passions are people, nature, and abstract.

            <q>My photography began from zero as a hobby, and it's evolved from there.
                It was never about being the best photographer ever, more like being a better photographer than myself a week ago.
                Much of what I've learnt has been self-taught - simply playing around, idealising a particular style ever now and then, and wondering what could be next.
                <br>
                The best part of this craft is it's basically only limited by what you and those around you can imagine.
                I love bringing a creative vision to life - bringing a part of our internal experience into reality.
                Seeing the smile on someone's face when your collaboration has brought about a way of seeing the world they never expected, that's priceless.</q>
