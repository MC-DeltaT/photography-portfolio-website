    "description": "The first day in Tongariro National Park, the visibility was the worst I had ever experienced. I was hoping for a stunning mountain range scene, yet given the conditions you could be forgiven for thinking there were no mountains in the area at all!\nAs we ascended what we could only assume was a mountain, the visibility became ridiculously poor. You could barely see the edge of the road (which ominously dropped off into the valleys below). The road ended at Turoa Ski Resort, abandoned for the summer months, where this shot was taken.",
