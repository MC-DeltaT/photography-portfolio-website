	"description": "The shot of Mount Tongariro which I consider to be my ultimate representation of the mountain. As we hiked across the crater plain, this magnificant scene of rawest natural awe unfolded. The giant remains of a previous cone of the volcano, with Mount Ngauruhoe looming in the background, and clouds swiftly rolling in across the heights.\nThis was a scene which forces one to see their place, as a small human, in a very large world designed by forces far beyond our control. The local Maori people know these mountains as a sacred site, and, after having the privilege to cross between them, it is no surprise why. It is times like these one cannot help but feel a transcendent connection to nature.",
