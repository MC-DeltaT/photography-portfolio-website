	"description": "This was one of the first shots taken after I acquired a high quality telephoto lens (Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 L IS USM). With this shot, I realised bird photography is a pay-to-win photographic style. Without such reach, there is no way I could have captured these quick little birds in action.",
