	"description": "I began studying photography after moving across Australia from Perth to Sydney. Having grown up with sunsets over the ocean, now I could not capture it in a photo due to Sydney's location on the east coast. When returning to Perth in 2024, I knew I must take such a shot. These beautiful sunsets are a reason why Western Australia will always hold a special place in my heart, no matter where I go.",
