    "location": "Shell Beach, Australia",
	"description": "Within the remarkable scenery of Shark Bay, I found Shell Beach, a beach with shells in place of sand. I had come to swim in the afternoon to avoid the harsh midday heat that permeates the near-shade-less landscape. And lucky I did, for this most incredible sunset scene evolved just I was about to leave. Sprinting to the car to grab my camera, I set up on the beach and shot continuously until the sun had disappeared beyond the horizon. At one point, the tripod  setup blew over in the wind (luckily the ground was not sand) yet it was worth it for the result.",
